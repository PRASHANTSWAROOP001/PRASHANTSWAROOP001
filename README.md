### Hi, I'm Prashant Swaroop 👋  

A **backend-focused full-stack developer** — yes, you heard that right.

Like most developers, I started with HTML, a button, and the magic of “something happens when you click it.” That curiosity pulled me deep into the web-dev jungle.

My adventure began with JavaScript and React — yep, even Redux and the chaos that comes with it. But once I touched backend development, I realized I was never really a frontend dev.  
It was always about performance, reliability, and how systems work under the hood.

Today, I enjoy building fault-tolerant, minimal, and scalable apps — learning and growing as a **backend engineer at heart**.
