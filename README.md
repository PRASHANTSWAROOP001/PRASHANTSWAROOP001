# Hi, I'm Prashant Swaroop ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m a **Full-Stack Developer** (with a growing focus on **Backend Engineering**) who loves exploring how systems work at scale.  
I enjoy diving deep into **system design, design patterns, and real-time applications** â€” building things that are both practical and scalable.  

ðŸ’¡ Currently learning more about **distributed systems and backend best practices** to level up my engineering skills.  

Outside of coding, I love to **write and share my learnings** â€” turning struggles into notes that help me (and hopefully others) grow.

### âš¡ Tech Stack  
- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python  
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Hono  
- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS, Azure, Docker  
- â€¦and a bunch of other tools I pick up along the way ðŸ™‚
